Итак, в ресторане есть открытая веранда на 10-12 столиков, и основной закрытый ресторан (огромный) в него пройти буквально 20 метров по улице (там стоит памятник хинкали). В основном кушают местные, и все они в диком восторге. Итак, ради чего мы пришли - покушать хинкали (мы бывалые путешественники, и мы знаем толк в Хинкали), принесли хинкали, мало мясо! Сок вытек, и многие их них уже переварили. Жареные - вкусные. Скажу так, в Москве, около метро Добрынинская, есть очень простая хинкальная, где они стоят столько же(45 рублей за штуку), но в разы!!! вкуснее!!! Итог: 1 литр домашнего гипнологом вина, 10 хинкали с мясном варёные, 7 с мясом жареные, маринованный перец, ассорти из сыров, хлеб, и баклажаны с орехами, итого на 3-х - 20000 драм, в счёт включают сразу 10% чаевых (имейте ввиду).

136544,136544,prices,"Открылся ресторан в Ереване 21/08/2022, мы с нетерпением ждали открытия и мечтали позавтракать в этом заведении. Когда узнали, что наконец день открытия настал, заранее забронировали столик, чтобы с комфортом позавтракать в таком чудесном месте. Все впечатление было испорчено прямо со входа в ресторан. Я зашла с улыбкой и поздоровалась, девушка, которая встречала гостей даже не попыталась изобразить радостный вид, поздоровалась сквозь зубы, стала искать мое имя в журнале бронирований. Отвела меня к столику - ок. Мне принесли меню, пока я ждала подругу, и я довольно быстро определилась с заказом. Официант ко мне не подходил минут 20, я уже умахалась всеми конечностями, но меня никто не замечал. В итоге ко мне подошла девушка, приняла у меня заказ. К слову я заказала чашку капучино и бриошь с лососем, бенедиктом и авокадо. Проходит еще минут 10, ко мне подходит официант и говорит: ""Бенедикт с лососем невозможен, так как закончилась бриошь"". И спрашивает: ""Вам принести меню?"" Ну я говорю, что да, само собой принести, хотя понимаю, что какая-то странная ситуация, учитывая, что в меню завтраков много позиций именно с бриошью. И вообще меня удивило, как это в пекарне в 11 утра закончился хлеб. В итоге мне принесли снова меню, я выбрала что-то альтернативное и больше ко мне никто не подошел, хотя видели, что я готова сделать заказ. К слову сказать, что завтраки в этом заведение до 12 утра, и я понимала, что если так будет продолжаться, то мы здесь точно не позавтракаем. В итоге, когда пришла подруга, мы просто ушли в другое заведение. Получается, что я полчаса просто так просидела в кафе, в котором на меня всем было наплевать. По факту из-за своего неумения общаться с клиентом, заведение потеряло сразу двоих. Я искренне не понимаю, почему, когда нет какого-то вида хлеба, не предложить то же само наполнение на другом хлебе/круассане? И почему персонал так долго не обращает внимание на клиентов? Или считается, что известного названия и высоких цен достаточно, а сервис по боку? Очень расстроил нас этот поход в PAUL, ожидали другого. Надеюсь, что руководство заведения все же увидит этот отзыв и обратит внимание на эти моменты и поработает с персоналом.

When we found out that the opening day had finally arrived, we booked a table in advance to have a comfortable breakfast in such a wonderful place. The whole experience was spoiled right from the entrance to the restaurant. I came in with a smile and said hello, the girl who met the guests did not even try to portray a joyful look, said hello through her teeth, began to look for my name in the booking log. She took me to a table - ok. They brought me the menu while I was waiting for a friend, and I quickly decided on the order. The waiter did not approach me for about 20 minutes, I already waved all my limbs, but no one noticed me. Eventually a lady came up to me and took my order. By the way, I ordered a cup of cappuccino and brioche with salmon, benedict and avocado. Another 10 minutes pass, the waiter comes up to me and says: ""Benedict with salmon is impossible, because the brioche is over."" And asks: ""Would you like a menu?"" Well, I say yes, of course, bring it, although I understand that it’s some kind of strange situation, given that there are a lot of items on the breakfast menu with brioche. In general, I was surprised how the bakery ran out of bread at 11 am. As a result, they brought me the menu again, I chose something alternative and no one else approached me, although they saw that I was ready to order. By the way, breakfasts in this establishment are until 12 am, and I understood that if this continues, then we definitely won’t have breakfast here. In the end, when a friend came, we just went to another institution. It turns out that I just sat for half an hour in a cafe where no one gave a damn about me. In fact, due to its inability to communicate with a client, the institution lost two at once. I honestly don't understand why, when there isn't some type of bread, not offer the same filling on another bread/croissant? And why is the staff so long does not pay attention to customers? Or is it considered that a well-known name and high prices are enough, and service is on the side? This trip to PAUL upset us very much, we expected another. I hope that the management of the institution will still see this review and pay attention to these points and work with the staff.","a restaurant opened in yerevan on 08/21/2022, we were looking forward to the opening and dreamed of having breakfast in this establishment. when we found out that the opening day had finally arrived, we booked a table in advance to have a comfortable breakfast in such a wonderful place. the whole experience was spoiled right from the entrance to the restaurant. i came in with a smile and said hello, the girl who met the guests did not even try to portray a joyful look, said hello through her teeth, began to look for my name in the booking log. she took me to a table - ok. they brought me the menu while i was waiting for a friend, and i quickly decided on the order. the waiter did not approach me for about 20 minutes, i already waved all my limbs, but no one noticed me. eventually a lady came up to me and took my order. by the way, i ordered a cup of cappuccino and brioche with salmon, benedict and avocado. another 10 minutes pass, the waiter comes up to me and says: ""benedict with salmon is impossible, because the brioche is over."" and asks: ""would you like a menu?"" well, i say yes, of course, bring it, although i understand that it’s some kind of strange situation, given that there are a lot of items on the breakfast menu with brioche. in general, i was surprised how the bakery ran out of bread at 11 am. as a result, they brought me the menu again, i chose something alternative and no one else approached me, although they saw that i was ready to order. by the way, breakfasts in this establishment are until 12 am, and i understood that if this continues, then we definitely won’t have breakfast here. in the end, when a friend came, we just went to another institution. it turns out that i just sat for half an hour in a cafe where no one gave a damn about me. in fact, due to its inability to communicate with a client, the institution lost two at once. i honestly don't understand why, when there isn't some type of bread, not offer the same filling on another bread/croissant? and why is the staff so long does not pay attention to customers? or is it considered that a well-known name and high prices are enough, and service is on the side? this trip to paul upset us very much, we expected another. i hope that the management of the institution will still see this review and pay attention to these points and work with the staff.","or is it considered that a well-known name and high prices are enough, and service is on the side?",adjective_2,,0.0,1.0,0.0,NA prices,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,prices

Искали местечко для ужина, в нашем отеле в этот вечер не работал ресторан, а мы вернулись с экскурсии голодные и немного не довольные проведённым днём, выхода не было пошли искать по Цахкадзору! Итак Туманян хинкали в цахкадзоре (не нашла отдельной страницы пишу здесь). Место очень приятное даже по интерьеру, все новое, стилизовано пожарными аксессуарами, интерьер современный, много зелени. К нам несколько раздражённым от голода на помощь пришёл Аран, и своим вниманием заботой окружил нас на весь вечер!! Вы знаете сама читаю такие отзывы - не верю! Но тут не могу не смолчать огромное ему персональное спасибо! Причём хочу отметить другие ребята не так активно занимались нашим столиком, но на любую просьбу тут же отзывались, видимо весь персонал очень приветливый и дружелюбный! В итоге мы хотели попробовать хаш, хинкали мясные варёные и с зеленью жареные, хочу отметить что такое хаш мы не знали))) Аран взял над нами шефство!))) он заботливо объяснил как заправить наваристый бульон всеми составляющими, как это блюдо кушать руками лавашом вместо ложки!! Вы знаете в тот момент я себя почувствовала гастрокритиком из мультфильма Рататуй!! Это какой то взрыв вкусовых ощущений, поиск сравнений и в итоге поняла что «такое» ранее не ела, а ещё нас Аран уговаривал не заказывать лишнего так как хаш очень сытный, мы действительно еле-еле осилили, но! Мы ж все таки настояли на хинкали и надкусив, я просто не смогла остановиться!!! Таких вкусных хинкали я не кушала ранее. Я честно говоря люблю вкусно и много покушать, но до отзыва дошла впервые))) Мы были с мамой и нам обеим так все понравилось просто слов больше не подберу! Все в целом замечательно и сам ресторан и официанты и, вершина блаженства, еда и напитки!!! Молодцы, визит к вам стал украшением дня, и вообще визита в Армению!

Салат с теплой свеклой произвел сильное впечатление ! И мы решили побывать в ресторане еще раз, чтобы взять этот салат снова, а заодно продолжить дегустацию армянской кухни. Во второй раз опять взяли баранину, но уже в лаваше (блюдо похоже на большой хинкали - см. фото) и опять салат со свеклой, а также наметили себе еще несколько блюд ... И вот тут хотелось бы отметить работу официанта Артура. Когда он, принимая заказ, увидел, что мы ""пошли в разгон"", он не выдержал и ... стал нас отговаривать ! Он рассказал нам, ЧТО мы собираемся заказывать; сообщил о размере этих блюд, которые обычно берут на компанию из 4-6 человек, то есть, дал понять, что мы это всё не съедим никак ! Это умерило наш пыл. Спасибо ему, что он нас вовремя притормозил ! И тогда мы обратились к Артуру за рекомендациями... Он рекомендовал вместо мяса на 6 чел., взять к намеченной нами баранине и Микс-салату еще и Walnut paste - холодную закуску. И всё запить красным чаем Nraneh Tea... После ужина мы поняли, как же прав оказался Артур, спасибо ему еще раз ! Мы не объелись, всего оказалось в меру. А холодную закуску Walnut paste мы просто вымазали хлебом с тарелки начисто !

Wir haben auf die die Vorspeise verzichtet und sind gleich bei den Khinkali eingestiegen, da wir grosse Fans der georgischen Teigtaschen sind. So bestellten wir reguläre Fleisch Khinkali und frittierte Fleich Khinkali. Man kann auch Khinkali mit Pilzen oder mit Käse bestellen, aber für einen Khinkali Fan ist das eigentlich keine Option. Nach dem wir die Khinkali erhalten haben, war für uns auch klar das die regulären (nicht frittiert) immernoch die Besten sind. Das Tumanyan Khinkali macht diese wirklich auch unglaublich lecker - obwohl sie teilweise etwas Plump rüberkommen. Wir waren auf jeden Fall begeistert. Zum Desser gab es dann den Napoleon Kuchen, der im Tumanyan Khinkali etwas anders intepretiert wird... es kommen ca. 4 Layers und dann eine dickere Buttercreme Schicht anstelle von Buttercreme nach jedem Layer. Macht es natürlich einfacher zum herstellen, aber wirkt etwas trocken. Trotzdem sehr lecker. Als wir die Rechnung erhalten haben, waren wir etwas schockiert, denn das Preis/Leistungs Verhältnis ist einfach sensationell.

So we ordered regular meat khinkali and fried meat khinkali. You can also order khinkali with mushrooms or with cheese, but that's not really an option for a khinkali fan.

Так как в Армении мы были первый раз, кухню совершенно не знаем, поэтому попросили нам что-нибудь посоветовать. Совершенно все, что нам порекомендовали было очень вкусно. Я не буду перечислять блюда, да и уже не вспомню как все называлось, но лично у меня сложилось впечатление, что совершенно вся еда в этом ресторане на высоте. Обслуживание супер! Все официанты великолепно знают меню, все очень приветливы и уже даже когда рассказывают про блюдо, становится вкусно :) Оформление ресторана тоже на высоте, есть и курящий зал, и не курящий, и открытая веранда.

Итак Туманян хинкали в цахкадзоре (не нашла отдельной страницы пишу здесь). Место очень приятное даже по интерьеру, все новое, стилизовано пожарными аксессуарами, интерьер современный, много зелени. К нам несколько раздражённым от голода на помощь пришёл Аран, и своим вниманием заботой окружил нас на весь вечер!! Вы знаете сама читаю такие отзывы - не верю! Но тут не могу не смолчать огромное ему персональное спасибо! Причём хочу отметить другие ребята не так активно занимались нашим столиком, но на любую просьбу тут же отзывались, видимо весь персонал очень приветливый и дружелюбный! В итоге мы хотели попробовать хаш, хинкали мясные варёные и с зеленью жареные, хочу отметить что такое хаш мы не знали))) Аран взял над нами шефство!))) он заботливо объяснил как заправить наваристый бульон всеми составляющими, как это блюдо кушать руками лавашом вместо ложки!! Вы знаете в тот момент я себя почувствовала гастрокритиком из мультфильма Рататуй!! Это какой то взрыв вкусовых ощущений, поиск сравнений и в итоге поняла что «такое» ранее не ела, а ещё нас Аран уговаривал не заказывать лишнего так как хаш очень сытный, мы действительно еле-еле осилили, но! Мы ж все таки настояли на хинкали и надкусив, я просто не смогла остановиться!!! Таких вкусных хинкали я не кушала ранее. Я честно говоря люблю вкусно и много покушать, но до отзыва дошла впервые))) Мы были с мамой и нам обеим так все понравилось просто слов больше не подберу!

Заказанные жареные хинкали принесли ещё через 40 минут! Почему? ""Потому что сначала варим, потом суши, потом жарим"". С интонацией - не нравится -не ешь. Жареные хинкали не закажу больше никогда...сколько лет тому фритюру, в котором их жарили - боюсь предположить. Как в дешёвой забегаловке на российском вокзале. Просто ""ФУ""( . О том, что гости за одним столом должны начинать есть одновременно, а не так: сначала одни смотрят в рот счастливцам, получившим заказанные блюдо, потом сытые (наполовину сытые) смотрят, как начинают есть другие, - это совершенно не про это заведение.

They called in advance to book a table (the place is always very crowded), to which the administrator said that there were only places in the smoking room, and then offered a table in the “old house on the second floor, it will be even more interesting for you there.” We didn't object. We arrived at the appointed time, we were led through the Khinkal, which was so praised, to a completely different institution (apparently with the same kitchen). The idea that Armenia is a friendly country was crushed by the service at this restaurant. The waiters did not even think about taking our order until too much time had already passed. In terms of atmosphere and prices, the application is still for a restaurant! And pour the compote (which we actually threw on the table) with the tan into glasses - no, we haven’t heard. The atmosphere is very uncomfortable. Everything contributes to this: music, the clatter of forks on plates (apparently only silent families are sent there, we did not get out).

Что ж..... пришли мы от силы на 5 минут ранее и спрашиваем так мол и так если готов стол то давайте мы сядем... посмотрели переглянулись и говорят пройдемте... поднимаемся на второй этаж и нам говорят ещё подождите чуть чуть....как б три женщины стоят около лестницы в проходе и ждут свой стол уже как б более 5 минут... в итоге улыбчивый официант подходит и говорит. знаете ваш занят ещё давайте за другой. а он оказался в самом центре зала и дуло там со всех сторон.... Что ж сидим изучаем меню, и ждем официанты ещё минут 15.... Сделали заказ... начали приносить блюда и напитки. Мы заказали себе вино. И первый бокал официант налил сам и все дальше мы уже либо сами наливали либо сидели по полчаса ждали когда к нам подойдут. Грязная посуда стояла на столе минут 20... Что самое не приятное в этом всем деле, что официанты просто напросто нас избегали, так как рядом с нами накрывали стол на большую компанию и за нами сидело тоже не 3 человека. Я всё конечно понимаю, но разве гости не равны для вас или для вас где больше чаевые оставят туда и бежим.

На что он принес извинения, и сказал что сейчас все наладиться.

Причем ещё с такими интонациями, что мол каждой по порции многовато, давайте один на троих...
